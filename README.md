# az-wish

A Clojure library designed to grab amazon.com wishlists.

## Usage

Currently a work in progress. You can run the code in a REPL to grab the sequence.

    (def my-wishlist (az-wish/wishlist "2B071NDZWAZPX"))

It will iterate through all pages of the wishlist to grab all items, with titles and links.
